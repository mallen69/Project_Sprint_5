Title: Exploratory & Analysis of US Contagious Diseases 


Sprint  - To write a script in R to read the CSV file containing US Contagious Disease.  Then to use R to perform initial exporatory analysis and to utilize the filter within the R Studio program to assist with the analysis. To write a script which calculates the disease per State by the highest percentage sick. 


As a Technology Teacher I need to be able to take a new dataset and be able to do preliminary exploratory analysis to determine what trends/analysis is relatively quickly apparent - which will provide direction for further analysis.  I hope to be able to use these concepts as I move further along in this program and also outside of this program after completion.


Set the proper working directory in R, read in the US Contagious Diseases dataset, performed exploratory analysis, wrote the script to calculate the disease per State by the highest percentage sick. Once discovered that the highest disease per State was Measles for every State, continued with script to find and calculate the specific disease per State by the highest percentage_sick and calculated the mean to prove Measles was in fact the highest.  Then focused on the entire dataset once again to perform ANOVA calculations in order to determine if there was any statistical significance, though it was most likely obvious Measles was statistically significant by performing a boxplot, though calculations are needed for sure and also to determine if other diseases are also statisically significant from each other.  

Things I learned:
Though I had been working with R for the past couple of months, by utilizing a new dataset (US Contagious Diseases) I learned the filter within R studio is great for quickly determing various analysis.  I learned not to be afraid of tackling a new dataset, in fact the script that I ended up writing will benefit my overall goal.  Especially learning how to perform statisitical analysis (ANOVA) though I have much to learn on the actual output.
